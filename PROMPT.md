- Citation-aware search
- Result ranking and reranking
- Performance monitoring

### 8. **LLM INTEGRATION & ANSWER GENERATION**
- Prompt engineering for legal contexts
- Context selection and filtering
- Answer generation and validation
- Citation formatting and verification
- Error handling and fallbacks

### 9. **API & SERVICE LAYER**
- FastAPI endpoint optimization
- Request/response handling
- Authentication and authorization
